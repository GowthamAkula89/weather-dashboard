# Weather Dashboard Platform
## Project Overview
This Weather Dashboard allows users to track the weather across multiple cities. Users can search for cities, add them to their dashboard, and view current weather conditions. The dashboard is built with React and TypeScript, ensuring a modern and type-safe experience.

## Features
- **City Search**: Quickly find and select cities using the search bar.
- **Debouncing API Calls**: Optimizes performance by reducing the frequency of API calls during user input.
- **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature displays.
- **Widget Management**: Add or remove weather widgets dynamically with user-friendly buttons.

### Using the Application
- **Adding a Widget**: Type the name of a city into the search bar, select it from the dropdown menu, and click the "Add" button.
- **Removing a Widget**: Click the delete icon on any widget to remove it from your dashboard.
- **Changing Temperature Units**: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit by clicking the respective button on the dashboard.

## Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication for personalized experiences.
- Integrate additional weather metrics, such as humidity and wind speed.
- Allow users to save their favorite cities for quick access.
